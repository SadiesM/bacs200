<h1>Nonprofit for at risk college students who face racial discrimination on campus</h1>

<p> This nonprofit was inspired by the recent events that have taken place at Colorado colleges surrounding racial discriminations, acts of violence against people of color, and these events inspiring radical racist actions that put students of color at risk.</p>
