            My inspiration comes from other people who have done the things I have been aspiring to do and are always striving to improve their lives and the peoples' lives around them. I dont usually become deeply inspired enough to live my life to the fullest by people distant to me, lie celebrities or public figures. I draw deeper inspiration through the people around me.

            The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>they are kind and help others</li>
            <li>they find ways to help themselves in a healthy manner</li>
            <li>they strive to improve their lives as well as others</li>
            <li>they aren't afraid to admit their flaws and work upon them</li>
